## CSE 110

This is my user page for [UCSD's CSE 110 Course](https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/CSE.html#cse110).

If you're interested, this is me:

I'm not really sure what the 'core' markdown elements are, so here are a few from the github flavored markdown formatting documentation:

### A list of postsecondary schools I have attended

 - University of Waterloo
 - Foothill College
 - UC San Diego

### A code block with the commands I will use to commit this page

```
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Although, I'll be pushing this using vscode, so I won't actually be using those commands :+1:.
